This is a documentation project to introduce the Perl
[XML::LibXML](https://metacpan.org/release/XML-LibXML) module through example
scripts.  The project is currently incomplete, but you can [view the
documentation here](http://grantm.github.io/perl-libxml-by-example/).

One of the features of this project is an [interactive XPath
sandbox](http://grantm.github.io/perl-libxml-by-example/_static/xpath-sandbox/xpath-sandbox.html)
which you can use to try out different XPath expressions and see which parts of
the document are matched.
