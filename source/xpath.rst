XPath Expressions
=================

As you saw in the :doc:`basic examples <basics>`, the ``findnodes()`` method
takes an XPath expression and finds nodes in the :doc:`DOM <xpath>` that match
the expression.  For example this expression:

.. code-block:: none

    //title

will match every ``<title>`` element in the document.
